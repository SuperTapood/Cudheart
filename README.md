## About the project
Cudheart is a numpy-esque library that aims to provide a simple and intuitive solution for CUDA based computing.
Currently only featuring C++ based functions, but CUDA stuff is coming I swear.


- [X] better fetching in ~~vector object~~ EVERYTHING
- [ ] DOCUMENTATION
- [X] arrays will now always copy given arrays
- [X] test direct vector creation with int and double
- [X] arrays now have multi dim indexing
- [ ] hide array fields
- [ ] add the rest of the datatypes
- [ ] actual info for the module (version and stuff)
- [X] add shape object to store multi dim size
- [ ] change from vector to array so i don't have a lot to change later
- [ ] add test and stuff for DChar and stuff
- [ ] add the rest of creation functions
- [ ] dtypes will now store a casted copy of the array to save time
