## About the project
This project is a numpy-esque CUDA C++ library to play around with vectors and matrices. 
<br>
This library takes great inspiration and attempts to mimic the structure of python's numpy library.
<br>
The aim of this project is to provide a back-end framework for a Tensorflow-esque library to be developed at a later date.
