## About the project
This project is a numpy-esque CUDA library to play around with vectors and matrices. 
<br>
The aim of this project is to provide a back end framework for a Tensorflow-esque library to be developed later.
<br>
Currently, no actual CUDA kernels are implemented, but they will be in the future.


- [ ] add namespaces!
- [ ] add the rest of matrix creation functions
- [ ] test matrix creation and conversion
- [ ] add custom complex numbers (Ai + B)
- [ ] add documentation
- [ ] add inf
- [ ] add negInf
- [ ] add NaN
- [ ] add calc funcs
- [ ] add trigo funcs
- [ ] add bitwise funcs
- [ ] add comparison funcs

p.s.: future me, please do remember to do all of the computations on flat vectors, and convert them "outside" of the math ty xoxo
